Food Consumption Research - Sample Data with Python Programming
Problem Statement
Going without a meal, or several, is a fear of many people in this world. This study found, hypothetically,
that one person donating three meals per day instead of wasting food potentially could be helping a family
of four in need with food for about 60 days. Fictional sample data as well as brief mental maps, planning
ideas, and conclusions are provided below together with Python programming and data analysis.
Disclaimer: This is not professional advice and the sample data in this document is not real. Here you
will find a personal project to simply demonstrate applied critical thinking and technical abilities.
